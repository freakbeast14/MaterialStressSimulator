We are hiring for a Web Developer II position in our Canonsburg, PA office!

We are seeking a Web Developer with expertise in Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Angular or React. The role involves developing the front-end for our web-based material calibration software.

                                                                                                     
In round 1 the Hiring Manager told me there will be a second round in which I need to demo something I built. So recommend me a good project with full step by step instructions (Assume I dont know any basics in coding) on how to build it in a week, so that I can show it in the demo. The project should be relevant to the above job description. It should be more frontend focused since its more of a frontend role.
